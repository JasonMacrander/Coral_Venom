# Assembling a Transcriptome with Trinity
This protocol outlines the steps required to assemble a transcriptome using the program Trinity.

# Prerequisites
Raw RNA-seq reads in FASTQ format
Trinity installed on your system
Assembling a Transcriptome with Trinity
Prepare your raw RNA-seq reads: Ensure that your reads are in a format that Trinity can accept, such as FASTQ or compressed FASTQ.

Run Trinity: Use the following command to run Trinity, replacing **left_reads.fq** and **right_reads.fq** with the path to your input files and trinity_out_dir with the directory where you want to output the Trinity assembly:

`
Trinity --seqType fq --left left_reads.fq --right right_reads.fq --max_memory 50G --CPU 8 --output trinity_out_dir
` 

In this command, --seqType specifies the input read type (fastq here), --left and --right specify the input read files, --max_memory specifies the maximum amount of memory to use, --CPU specifies the number of CPUs to use, and --output specifies the output directory for the Trinity assembly.

Analyze the Trinity assembly: Once Trinity completes, the output directory will contain several files, including the Trinity.fasta file which contains the assembled transcriptome. You can then use downstream tools to analyze the transcriptome assembly.
